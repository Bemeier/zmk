# SCHIFFRE 86

The schiffre 86 is a custom mechanical keyboard with compact FRL 1800-like layout.
It features a separate host board (schiffrenrf) for USB and Bluetooth, to allow for a flexible plate impoved position of the bluetooth antenna.

For flexible mounting, schiffre uses a 30-pin Flexible Flat Cable (FFC) as interconnect.
A custom interconnect was also required as the existing interconnects typically lack the required GPIO pins for larger layouts.

See the [github repository](https://github.com/Bemeier/schiffre) for more information.
